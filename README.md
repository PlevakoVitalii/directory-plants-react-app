## Plant-directory-react-app

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PlevakoVitalii/directory-plants-react-app/master/plant-directory-screen.bmp)

Deployed book-store-react-app here [Book-store](https://plevakovitalii.github.io/directory-plants-react-app/plant-directory/).

Implemented functionality:

- render in slider list of items from array;
- transition between pages without reloading;
- using React bootstrap.

In this project I mastered:

- React
- react-create-app
- react-router-dom
- React-bootstrap
- npm gh-pages

All components are in the `src` folder. All another files was generated by `react-create-app`

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone branch `review` with `git clone https://github.com/PlevakoVitalii/directory-plants-react-app.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
